# DSA
Here are some intro programs and foundation for Data structures and Algorithms. That I have learnt when i started my dsa journey

These codes are from CodeWithHarry DSA playlist in C language.
One who is starting his/her dsa journey, i prefer them to learn and build a strong foundation about each data structure and it's implementation. Which is helpul in understanding, implementing and solving problems.

Here is the link for [CodeWithHarry DSA course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9ahIappRPN0MCAgtOu3lQjQi).

</Happy coding>
